INFO (XSTRM-288): Performing automatic layer mapping because either the layer mapping information is not provided or the XST_AUTO_LM  value is used with the '-layerMap' option. Additionally, the  'xStrmOut_layerMap.txt' file has been generated and the mapping information has been added to it.
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the '-viaMap' option for preserving oaVia instances in a XStream Out - XStream In round trip. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.

INFO (XSTRM-180): You have not used the '-objectMap' option. The design has instance(s) of at least one of following OpenAccess objects: oaBlockage, oaBoundary, oaRow, and oaMarker. Any information about these objects will not be translated into the generated stream file. Use the '-objectMap' option to translate/preserve these objects using XStream.
